# Goal

This project is very defined, so our goals will be few in number and centered around the key questions that can be found below:

Develop a model that predicts the likelihood of a customer (identified by a customer_ID) to buy tires in the month of November 2018.
Take our modelâ€™s 100,000 mostly likely to buy and submit that list for testing
If possible, determine why our model is predicting how it is by looking at feature importance and potentially using other methods
Present the model and any interesting insights that may be valuable in a presentation to the client on May 2nd


# Background  

The problem for this project is one of customer prediction. We will be working for Bridgestone and our chief goal will be to predict customers that will buy tires in the month of december given the last few years of sales data. The idea is to use this information to know which customers will be influenced to buy tires by sending them emails to increase the amount of tires sold. Upon completion, this model could be used to tell Bridgestone who they should be emailing and targeting with advertising to maximize the sales of their premiere product: Tires.

# Data

The data for this project is Bridgestone's sales data from Apr 2015 to Oct 2018, stored in separate csv files for each month.

## Data security

Data is stored on Accre as it is private to Bridgestone

# Models

The model predicts the probability of buying tires in the target month for each individual present in the entire training data. For the sample submission, the model generates a list of the top 100,000 most likely to buy tires and returns that list in csv format

# Timeline

Start of Project: Mar 14th, 2022

Project Deadline: May 2nd, 2022

# Repo Structure

The repo is structured as follows: All *0- (e.g., 10-, 20-, 30-) files contain finalized work for the purpose described (e.g., "process-data"). Subfiles related to the task (e.g., 11-, 12-) should be created in order to explore and document relevant or interesting subtasks.

All files which appear in the repo should be able to run, and not contain error or blank cell lines, even if they are relatively midway in development of the proposed task. All notebooks relating to the analysis should have a numerical prefix (e.g., 31-) followed by the exploration (e.g. 31-text-labeling). Any utility notebooks should not be numbered, but be named according to their purpose. All notebooks should have lowercase and hyphenated titles (e.g., 10-process-data not 10-Process-Data). All notebooks should adhere to literate programming practices (i.e., markdown writing to describe problems, assumptions, conclusions) and provide adequate although not superfluous code comments.
