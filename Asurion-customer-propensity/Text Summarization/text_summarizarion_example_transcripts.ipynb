Two [NUMBER] [NUMBER] [NUMBER] [NUMBER] [NUMBER] [NUMBER] [NUMBER] [NUMBER] six. Ok. And while pulling that account, Let me ask what's going on. How can we help out? Um, If for some reason we get disconnected you have my phone number, right? So let me confirm. I do see the uh, the phone number you're calling from, can you confirm the last four digits just to be sure? It's two six zero four one seven zero nine three six. Mkay. So saying yep. I do see that number. So of course, if something happens. I definitely would contact you back. Alright. Because the last the Hit through three customer representatives. I think since I talked to a Tech Coach, And we got disconnected and they didn't call me back. So I'm trying to figure out what the hell Mhmm. whatever. So last Friday, I called in says my Wifi hotspot does not work on my phone. Previously, fourteen months prior to that roughly. I tried fixing forget calling you guys and fixing it and it didn't work and then I Hmm. forgot about it. I didn't need the Wifi hotspot wall Now I do. So last Friday I called in, I think ain't it talking to somebody from Asurion, I think Mhmm. I don't know. So we did all the tech support stuff or troubleshooting over the phone. then she determined that my phone was bad my hardware. My phone. Ok. Mhmm. So She was gonna warranty the phone. But then It had to be a good condition to be warranty. Well, my my screen was cracked. Right. she sent me to a u break store to get this screen fix, which I did on Friday. Hold on. Mhmm. So the phone fixed. So I called in. I started this process about fifty minutes ago trying to complete the second step of this warranty process. of She told me that you guys would send me a new phone. And I would send the old one back. I guess. So then I have a new phone and the hotspot should work on it. So I called back Today, twelve roughly * And that lady sent me to wanna I think that was somebody from Asurion. I talked to and then she sent me to the tech Support or Tech Coach. got disconnected and I talked to either think maybe one, I don't know. Somebody. I don't know who was Asurion it was coach. I don't know. then that's how I end up talking to you. So he was trying to put me through all the. the last guy i talked to who transferred me to you tried to go through all the troubleshooting steps again like, unless you got something new for me, I go, we've done this. Nope. troubleshooting has been done I'm here for a warranty claim. And that's what how I ended up talking to you. So Right. Ok. So obviously, I don't know. I don't know. I keep getting bounce back force us that's what I feel what's happening here. Right. And that's the last thing one especially when you're trying to get this taken care of and get a phone that, you know, you can utilize and use that hotspot that you've been paying for it this whole time. Right? Uh, so obviously, that's you. So no, I'm I'm sorry that we would Correct. went through that. I'll be more than happy to help you out and see exactly what we need to do this to get out that phone for you, Right? You already went through the process you'll go into the Back six Getting that screen repaired just so we can make sure when we go to the warranty, obviously that there's there's no damage. Um, you know, fee that you get there for sure. So I'm just checking one system because see the remarks on the account um, for the rep that you mentioned kind of first went through those steps went through everything and then advise you to kinda you if you get your phone fixed looks like that Rep did notate that we kinda went through everything including the reset. Just do wanna confirm. We have a system on Our end that allows us. to confirm normally Um, that that was done, but it looks like that's not working well let me just review there rest Remarks. one which time. I like them, so it's clear. Oh. So we went through. We did the. we went through the General settings and we did reset network settings. went through that. And then when I got done, that didn't work so then we did the reset settings. And that didn't work. So if you got something else to try. And I remember, I think that's what we did. fourteen months ago and it didn't work then either. Ok. So based off of what you're describing and then, you know, what So. was documented and and that's why the specific language sometimes Not document a problem, but I'm uh, what's gonna go with the but no from what you're describing that that does sound like, um, know, the two resets of the settings and the network settings. It is actually something that's required when the warranty replacement is issued, Right, which of course we'll be at no cost to you Um, with there be no physical or liquid damage excuse. Ok You do have to go through a complete backup. right, And then a a factory data reset. right. Without kinda of restoring the content on your device, whether it's through like, a Google backup or however you choose the back up your content we of course, would ensure everything does get backed up first. Uh but you, that step is required before warranty replacement can be issue for sure. So said the factory data reset has to take place? That is correct. I'm sorry. I wasn't explain to you prior that was going based off I was assuming that we actually had done that And with our system Not working I was actually about the process so I'm glad you mentioned that cause you may have actually saved Mitel. Um, from just trying to be here and make sure we get this done free you. But yes that that would need to be done for sure. Um, we can walk you a back up and see do you have Wifi right now. No, I don't. Available. And do you have Wifi at your home? Nope. Yes, I do. Ok. So, um, we can, uh you may already be backing up to Google automatically. Right Since you have Wifi, home, you should be able to put potentially see the date of the last backup. Obviously usually we won't do anything until we can do another backup just to sure but just to see if you are back up, can you get to your settings and then Google? Go to settings and what? And then Google. It's actually a setting as well. Oh, sorry. I didn't notice. I didn't know. Yep. And then from that page, once you get on Google should do enough right back up. Ok. Ok. And then, um, it should be like a date next to those potential last backup on that screen. Do you see that? It looks like it was May to eight zero one Am. Ok. So that's about, um, nine days. Right? Hello. obviously, wanna make sure you can get everything back up. so we're probably gonna need to get back to Wifi. Do you know where you're gonna be, um, Not connected. To home. I should say? Uh, it'll be this evening sometime time. Receiving Ok. Well, It'll be late this evening since I gotta my daughter's got soft phone, so Oh, Ok. How old your daughter? You don't mind me asking. Ok Uh, she's junior here in high school. Thank Oh, Ok. Ok. So that has to be interesting. she was about to me a senior next year. Um, is there something locking again? Yep. Let's need just starting on? Oh, no. Not really. It's a small school they're very very shallow. So don't have there's like eleven players. Oh, ok. Oh, Ok. Ok. Ok. It's ok not a lot not a lot of people. It's just No. I mean, I know it's enough to put Gotcha. Right. When you left people on the field, but I mean, we have one picture, so. right. Yeah. So it's hard to be consistent and when you know that ok. But no, obviously the sport of competition is is it's used as well So that that's cool. Obviously, we gotta get this fixed though. So do you know, um, because we don't close until eleven o'clock your time Mkay. you've been kinda dealing with this for a long time. It sounds like, right. And I wanna make we there's literally nothing else we have to do. Um, So the. Uh, if you want we can set up a follow, we will reach back out to you. Ok. um, you know, first two text message and then uh, you respond yes, like you didn't help then, and we'll give you a call. Um, Do you know around what time we can reach out to you? probably eight thirty Pm eastern time. Ok. Let me get that set up really quickly. six eight Can I backup up over cellular? You know, you uh can depending on the settings, um, sometimes it's actually a software. Ok. issues as well. You can try, um, you can go through like, the backup now. Uh, And Ok. And then I know we can change it on Google Photo specifically. know if there's a setting change on the rest of the content, like contacts, sir. app data backup, things like that. Mkay. Alright. What phone number can I reach you guys at is somehow we get this or. Is there a way to get a hold of your directly. Um, so we do basically, it's just I'm not sure what number you call, but it should be the eight hundred nine two two Zero two zero four it's option two. Ok. for technical support. Right. And then also if you always, you can always just use the Tech Coach app. Alright. a lot of people don't use anymore, Um, but that's also like a direct way to just get directly in contact with us as well. Uh, Ok. Um, but yeah, I'm sorry. You said eight. Eastern Time. Right? Correct. Give me a second. Let just make sure so i taken can. Ok. Alright. And then obviously like I said, Um, after this backup up and then reset, there won't be anything else uh i can promise you. I can assure you. All these calls are recorded. right So we don't want you to have to do anything it's been up. crazy time so far, And I really apologize at couldn't get this taken care of so you can just use your hotspot right now.

But we we're sitting in the in the parking lapse By [CLIENT] service, uh, company and they said this this would happens frequently uh with that iphone twelve. And that we we bought bought these two. The one in my hand right now. which is my wife's uh, and mine, which is gone dead. in in, uh, December. So you can check the file and see. uh her number is nine one four four seven five nine one nine four. Thanks, Daisy. Ok. That's the one I'm on now. mine as I've given to you is is it's is useless. and it puts silly totally fully charged. and I can get it to work on Bluetooth. So So obviously, it's it has a mechanical issue. That apparently, it's I'm not the first one. Yes, sir. And I'm sorry. That you. Um, that you're having that problem but I definitely be able to further assist with that. And suggest to confirm, there's no physical damage, um, on your screen. Right? That's correct. There was no physical damage We think it's Ok. Ok we were just with to [CLIENT] people. they said to tell you Uh, that that that that's right. There is no visible damage we. i've never dropped it. Uh, I've never been an a web condition or anything. It just quit. And so it it's brand new. Ok. And they just started today or how long has this been going off for you? Uh literally two hours ago. two hours of them. it just quit. I used it all morning. Ok. and uh, I was working as as usual, very hard. Ok. Uh, yeah. And uh and so Yep. Oh, and all of a sudden it just went black. And so when I press both sides, we tried to reboot it. couldn't do that. uh, the guys here at [CLIENT] did a force, three reboot. and uh, nothing. And they said there is a plate underneath the screen. And when that plate goes, Uh, there is nothing anyone can do, but know, either buy a new phone or have you guys uh take care of it. So Ok. you probably have seen quite a few of these uh, Yeah. I guess we have. I had to I'm unfortunately. Yeah. And I actually experienced that with my phone. I have, um, but I have a have an. um it didn't completely start working. But it was not working for hours. I almost an entire your day. Oh. So I definitely don't. Yeah. I wasn't able to call. I couldn't even, like, I had to use Siri like, the siri wasn't really working either. So it's like I had to, if not working at like, four Pm in the middle of the day and I can use it. the very next morning. So it was. Yeah. Yeah. You can tell from what Definitely. that's that sense I can uh, actually got it to work on Bluetooth. that obviously see they, uh, uh, the the wireless part of this is just fine. It's it's obviously the ability to access it. without having to have a car uh, and the Bluetooth and if it i had Bluetooth hooked up in advance, Morning. then I the Bluetooth wouldn't work either obviously cause I couldn't I couldn't get commands. to the screen to be able to obtain what I've been able to do so So you can tell that that obviously it's a it's a mechanical function. Yeah. uh yes so What I need is. Uh. So what do we do? Can you tell can you see which card which which Which model I have, there on the screen. Yes. You have the, um, iphone thirteen Pro That's it. A look forward than my wife You have the silver. the silver here. Yeah. My wife has a little bit larger one. Yeah. Yes. And her number was it the * Yeah. Ok. he is yeah. Let's see.

Uh, and uh, Yeah. I guess it just hasn't a white back. just the wait plate back and Mhmm. and, uh And then I I guess, I guess I can just yes I just log on to my onto my system. Yeah. Then the a new unit should should automatically pick up where this one has dropped off. So Yep. You'll have to set this one. I guess you have to shut this down and activate an. Yes. Yes. Yeah.

And just waiting for it a response. Ok. Ok. So let's see. Ok. See I'm gonna pull up some troubleshooting. steps and see if we can get it to come on. But of course, it it probably won't. Since that's like a common issue, but we're gonna hope hello No. I would love for it to happen but the we literally you're sitting in the parking lots. of the [CLIENT] people there. over, you know, what whatever manager over overrun Ok. absolutely nothing. So And we. And we bought our phones from from them over the years they're here in Pleasant Valley. Gotcha. Ok. but ok Mkay. it shouldn't be much longer for a response. cause normally like when when this issue happened where like your device can't come on and you know, we can't do any troubleshooting. normally, like, I would have to get you two tier two. So, like, the ticket can be, um, like, in your account, that they know, like, you know, so you won't get charged. Cause it has to be processed service way so you won't get charged because, you know, all of the troubleshooting we have to get done, plus, you know, factory it and since they taken done. I just wanted to make sure that, you know, I go about this I know exactly. What you mean. the right way. You. exactly. So the right way we're we're we're not in that in a hurry at the moment. comfortable. Ok. I do wanna say thank you for your patience. Nope. yes. Cause I like I said, I definitely wanna make sure I get this figured out for you guys. Thank So you guys get in. At least enjoy your day. beside all of the the, uh, tech issues with your phone. Well, yeah. These things happen we Yeah. we it just moved up from [STATE] for a a few weeks. Hmm. uh, to proper where we raise our children in update new [STATE] and the Hudson Valley. Mhmm. And there so many thousands of things that need to be attended to. you know, the door is squeak. and Windows sent work and uh, the cards the cars need repair. and, uh, you know, lights your out. and so all will be thing need to be done. And, uh and so we. We do have family members that that are watching over things for us, but Bye. that, you know, it's it's always always something as you know. So today. in addition to everything else it's the phone. Sir. And I used I used phone so much. Hi. So much. I do. thank Ok, that's great. I do have my ipad. And maybe you could you're looking at the file. If you could tell me uh when you when you finish all your diagnostics, how do I can use my because I if the ipad does have a phone number connected to it. I just have never used it. So in in the next in the short term I could somehow be able to use my ipad. That would be great. Yes. I can definitely take a look. Because basically, since. Let me see. And it actually, it you should actually be able to use it now because it has, you know, service it has cellular service. So in the way I yeah. So you should be able to use it actually Right. It. because in the way you know that you would be able to use it. is, of course, um, let me see. I've never I've never used that function on I've had before I used it as a radar Hmm. I use it to send into my, uh, email account. those are the Print. ninety percent. I've never used it as a phone. Oh, and I I've only used it once or twice. as as a uh as a, uh, no um, camera. So the camera I understand got on those things too, so I've I've used it for the things that are database, but but not not camera not phone. So I I I know we have we pay for it. We pay for it with to [CLIENT]. Uh, but I don't know how to use So i'll I'll look into that or you can tell me. what I need to do, but I don't have it with me right now. So Ok. we just have my wife's phone, uh here that you can see the screen then you can see what we're working on with my phone. Yes. Yes. Cause in, Ok. So basically, with the tablet. So since you since so since you do have its own number and it's you know, on an actual plan then it has cellular service. So, you know, you can use it outside of Wifi Because if it if it wasn't then, you know, you would have only been able usage and Wifi, if it Thank was like on the actual plan? That's what we pay. That's what we pay for that lock. Yeah. Hmm. even though I haven't used I need to figure out how to use this. So this will be a good blessing. it'll be a blessing and instance and disguise. Yes. And then also, you can sign in are you signing into your icloud on the ipad? Ok. So, yes. If you should be able to, you know, text Yes. Yes. Indeed. you know, text call and do whatever just like on the actual phone. it works yeah, just like that. Ok. Wonderful. Thank Ok. Yes. something new this afternoon. Yes, sir.

So you have been calling in because you just, you know, get a replacement extended remount, I know that at home point, we told you, Hey what we haven't a already sent this warranty, which is the [CLIENT] Home device protect But for some reason, it still is not active in your account. do you know the reason why that? it's not access my account. is not active. The [CLIENT] home device protect is not active. So they put in here that they mentioned that to you. for some reason was not activated, I I don't know. Like, they just missed that part Ok. I was hoping that you can tell me what happened. Oh. I don't knew. I don't know how to how do I activate I have to be hooked up to to act to up to it. Right? Oh, no. No No. I mean, we are not talking about the extended anymore. Don't worry. Ok. So we're going to work for you to have it active. Ok? Ok. That's the reason why were going to escalate it or we already escalated we our our tier department. However, Also, the system is showing us that day [CLIENT] home device protect the extended warranty has never been activated in your account So what is not there? This system says, hey, this is missing. This is Mason. please have the customer why. So that's the reason why I'm asking if so whenever explain that to you if you know what that is, you. No. I have no idea what that is. You have no idea. So Ok. So maybe that's the reason why you don't have No. because no one ever is playing that to you. Ok, there from. Let me tell you real quick. Ok? So, Ok. this is going to cover or or you to help us to cover. I'll leave with the number of eligible devices at home. Ok? So something happens to them. They can be repaired or replaced for brand new devices. that means that it gives you up to find samsung dollars that you can use. in order to do any claims. Ok? so any acts any problem, you know that you will need to take like, more money out of your pocket. Is going to be already covered twenty so you're going to have the whole * dollars there. every twelve months for you to use it you see? as most as as as much as you you're talking about warranties on my phones and stuff? Yeah. Correct. So we have the one for the phone, which is different from the one For the [CLIENT] home device protect. Yes. You're right. Now see, I I don't buy my phones from Verizon On ebay open Mhmm. cause I I I don't wanna pay that thousand dollars or whatever. Verizon phones are. I buy Them on ebay and get my phone's cheaper. Idefinitely even buy Sometimes by used ones. usually it's an open box. new phone number displayed. Oh, that is not. Yeah i i've heard about that. But like most of the time it's like, brand brand new devices is correct? Yeah. I hear about that. Yeah. So I I don't need mic on my phones because I buy the open box once. pretty reasonable. Uh, two fifty. Three. Yeah. Ok. Ok. Not a problem. And what about the verizon home device with that? Because well I understand you don't use it for your phone because it's already covered ok with best buy. So that part is fine. And when what of all the other stuff. Uh, That's all I have through Verizon is my is the extended and Alright. three phones. That's two. Yeah. No. But I mean, in this, it the myverizon if they are from Verizon or not. you see. Like we cover everything every brand. Like, Even if you don't have it with us, it doesn't have to be with us actually. any brand, you know, pocket or Samsung or um, um, Apple or. Well what Brian it is. Oh, yeah. See. I even buy my uh, I burned my laptop the bunch up. I don't buy those bread. And I I don't need done it cause it say Mhmm. I'll just one for two hundred dollar. Oh, Ok. So let me see if I get this straight, like, it's like you already let's say you already have something similar to cover. Yes. Correct. Yes. Oh ok. Thank. now I understand. So there no problem is what I do is that Are explaining here? that you don't have the Verizon Home device Because you already have like that already. Covid for example, your laptop and things like that. Ok? mhmm And then I can close the other. You see? It was just for the reason. Ok. Ok. So not problem. Let me see here. Yeah. It's because, you know, I think we're still before we have kind of the other. So whenever using up there the system is like hey, what is it happening? Why not there? So that's the reason why we asking him. Ok. Alright. It's just for that. Ok? Ok, my. So, everything that we have done of course, it's on your account. Ok? The account is fully notated. Then we're going to wait for our second level department to reach you. so they can go extra. Ok? Because in here we can do it was already Ok. done and it doesn't have any sense for us to repeat steps. Ok? Mkay. So instead of doing that, we can go you know, hardly be ahead and see. What else?
